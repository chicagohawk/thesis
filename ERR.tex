Solve 
$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} 
 + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} =1
$$
on a 3D Cartesian grid, with
$$
0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y = 1, 0 <= z <=1
$$
All $x,y,z$ axes are discretized by $n=16$ segments (finest grid). Boundary condition is
$u=0$. Solve this equation with V-cycle multigrid. For each coarser iteration, please
reduce the discretization on all 3 axes by a factor of 2. You can use a direct solver
for the coarsest grid.
Pre-smooth and post-smooth
both with 5 relaxed Gauss-Seidel iterations. Set the relaxation factor $w=0.5$.
We'll compare the minimum value of your multigrid solution and a direct solver's solution.
The relative error is expected to be on the magnitude of 5\%.
